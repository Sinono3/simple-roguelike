Currently in EARLY-EARLY-EARLY stages. So no maps, graphics or complex AI yet.

## Current goals with this game
* Have a working battle system (turns, order, buffs and debuffs, minimal use of borrows or pointers.)
* Be able to name and customize creatures, while working with AI, and specific behaviors with each creature.
* Be able to load creatures from a file (JSON, TOML, XML, whichever)
* Random encounter mode: where creatures spawn and player has to fight them.
